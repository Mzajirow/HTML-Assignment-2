      My journey began with a deep desire to change my life professionally and
      personally. I knew I wanted more than just a job, I wanted a future-proof
      and secure career I could grow in. I began exploring new paths and
      ventured into software engineering, machine learning, data analytics, and
      several other programs in search of clarity. Along the way, I participated
      in the McKinsey Forward Program and the African Leadership Experience
      (ALX)’s Professional Foundation. It was during my time at ALX that I
      discovered cloud engineering and knew I had found my path.

      Since then, I’ve earned two AWS certifications and dived deep into
      building scalable, cloud-based solutions. Every step I take is rooted in
      my values: resilience, integrity and a genuine commitment to solving
      problems and creating real value.

      Today, I’m building a career in tech with a clear focus on cloud
      computing. My goal isn’t just to succeed—it’s to be impactful, to help
      teams grow through innovation, and to become a trusted expert in my field.
      With dedication and hardwork, I aspire to work with a FAANG Company in the
      next ten years.

      And when I’m not working or deep in studying about cloud engineering,
      you'll find me speaking somewhere or unwinding at the beach to reset and
      recharge.
