    <h3 id="#top">Biography</h3>
    <p>
      My name is <b>Ejiroghene Vivian Okpirikhre</b>, but most people simply
      call me Ejiro because it's simple and short. However, a few people have
      their own special nicknames for me, which I think is pretty cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a graduate of Business Administration from the Federal University of
      Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB). I'm a dynamic and driven professional with
      nearly five years of experience in the media sector, currently
      transitioning into a career in cloud engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently a student at the School of Engineering at AltSchool, and I’m
      really excited about the knowledge and hands-on experience I’ll gain from
      the program. My AltSchool ID is <b>ALT/SOE/025/4910</b>, which I believe
      means I’m the 4910th student in the 2025 admission cohort, which I find
      interesting. It’s inspiring to know that there are many others like me who
      are either transitioning into tech or just beginning their professional
      journey in this space. I’m looking forward to learning, growing, and
      collaborating with the amazing AltSchool community.
    </p>

    <p>
      It feels like I’ve been rambling a bit <em>lol</em>, but I’m just using
      this opportunity to document my thoughts at the beginning of my AltSchool
      journey.

    <!--Reason for joining the altschool cloud engineering program-->
    <h3 id="Q2">Why did I join the program and why AltSchool?</h3>
    <p>
      My short and simple answer is to learn and transition into a thriving
      career in Cloud Engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I have a successful career in the media sector. I work as a
      content developer and client manager for one of Nigeria’s leading online
      media houses, a role I’ve held for almost five years. While the niche is
      relatively exciting and fun, I’ve been yearning for something more
      challenging, dynamic, and future-proof.
    </p>

    <p>
      That hunger led me to tech, and I eventually decided to pursue a career in
      cloud engineering. I enrolled in a school and earned two AWS (Amazon Web
      Services) certifications—the AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions
      Architect.

    <p><b>My AWS Badges</b></p>

    <div
      data-iframe-width="150"
      data-iframe-height="270"
      data-share-badge-id="abf270f7-198b-4554-a542-cef4490312ca"
      data-share-badge-host="https://www.credly.com"

    <script
      type="text/javascript"
      async
      src="//cdn.credly.com/assets/utilities/embed.js"
    ></script>

    <p>
      The badges look cool, right? However, with time, the excitement faded
      because I realized that certifications alone are not enough to break into
      tech and deliver real value to my future employers. I needed more. I
      needed to learn programming, scripting, and other cloud platforms beyond
      AWS, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. This is
      important because companies use different cloud services, and having a
      foundational knowledge of the major providers gives me a competitive edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried self-learning through YouTube and online courses, which were
      great, but I knew I needed a more structured form of learning. That’s what
      led me to AltSchool. I’d heard about AltSchool on social media,
      specifically Twitter, so I decided to check the website. I reached out to
      a recent graduate of the program for a testimonial and he gave positive
      feedback. So here I am <em>lol</em>.

    <!--Goals for the AltSchool Program-->
    <h3>My goals for the program</h3>
    <p>
      My goal for this program is to gain deep, practical knowledge of my cloud computing and become a confident cloud engineer. I also aim to land an
      internship or full-time role by the end of the program, marking a pivotal
      switch into a tech career.
